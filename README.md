### Toolbelt

#### What is it?

The tools in this application contains very simple, 3rd party tools that I use frequently during workdays.

But that's the problem. Being dependent on 3rd party applications/services. For example, the md5.cz site was disabled in the past weeks and I had a lot of trouble during this time.

Because I was able to open the md5.cz site in the side tab with my muscle memory, quickly perform the encryption process without removing my hand from the keyboard, return to the previous tab and make the necessary changes. Unfortunately the alternatives were not good enough for my taste.

After all, this application will be a platform where I collect my tools just like that.

#### What tools are included?

For now, there is an alarm clock tool, a tool to check if the webcam and microphone are working, and finally the MD5 encoder.

Coming soon includes:

- a markdown notebook ('MDpad' in the pictures)
- screenshot tool (image and video)
- ~~steam~~, epic and xbox game launchers
- android virtual devices launcher
- project creator and launcher
- browser bookmarks panel (maybe)
- ssh public/private key switcher
- ssh launcher

...and hell, maybe a good music player will be awesome

#### Why electronjs?

Because i have a windows laptop, a linux laptop and a macbook in the office :)
